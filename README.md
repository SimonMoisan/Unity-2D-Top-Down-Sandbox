# Unity-2D-Top-Down-Sandbox

In this sandbox, I have created assets for a 2D Top Down game with several features.

Right now the character :
- Can be controlled (move and collide with obstacles) with mouse and keyboard.
- Pickup various items on the floor.
- Drop items, use or equip items in its inventory.

## About this Git :

I made this git in order to show my progresses in my self-learning trip as a game developper with Unity.
